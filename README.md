# Netflix-Clone
Netflix clone with an intuitive "Non-Responsive" interface .

I've developed a Netflix clone that replicates the core features of the popular streaming platform. The goal was to create a replica of the website, focusing on mimicking its overall look and feel. This project highlights my ability to design an intuitive user interface and implement features like media browsing. Built using modern web technologies, the clone aims to capture the essence of Netflix's user experience. While it doesnâ€™t include user authentication, media browsing, or a fully responsive design, the primary focus was on creating an accurate replica of the website.
