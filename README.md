# Netflix-Clone
Netflix clone with an intuitive "Non-Responsive" interface .

I’ve developed a Netflix clone that replicates the core features of the popular streaming platform. This project was primarily a learning exercise to explore React.js while recreating Netflix’s overall look and feel. Built with modern web technologies, the clone captures the essence of Netflix’s user interface but does not include user authentication, media browsing, or a fully responsive design. The focus was on mastering React.js through hands-on development rather than building a fully functional streaming service.
